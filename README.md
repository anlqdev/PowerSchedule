# Explaining error

To ensure the best support, I will match the error code to the operating system error code!

- Error 1190: Set the calendar too many times (Limit: 1 schedule per times)
- Error 89: Set maximum over time (Limit: 10 years)
- Error 1116: There are no schedules to cancel
- Other error: Please report bug!

Bonus: If you set the time without error but there is no noftication in the noftication bar, or the app not respond. Please report bug now!
